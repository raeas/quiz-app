# Quiz App

This project is an exercise for Thinkful's "Interactive Web Apps" module

## Module: Interactive Web Apps

### Objectives
* Build an interactive quiz app from scratch. This app will give you an opportunity to bring together all of the skills we've covered in this module
  * DOM traversal and manipulation
  * Event listeners

### Requirements
* Include a render() function, that conditionally regenerates the view each time the store is updated.
* Include single-purpose template generation functions.
* Include single-purpose event handler functions.
* Call all functions from a jQuery initializing function.
* NOT add additional HTML elements to the boilerplate code's index.html file (you may add attributes, e.g., classes and ids, to the existing HTML elements, or link stylesheets or additional scripts if necessary).
* Render answer choices in a <form>.
* Use semantic HTML, along with CSS and jQuery.
* Follow a11y best practices.
* Be fully usable by keyboard (which will be easy enough if you start with a form).
* Use responsive design.

### Tech Stack
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
